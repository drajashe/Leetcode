"""Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer."""class Solution(object):    def findRestaurant(self, list1, list2):        """        :type list1: List[str]        :type list2: List[str]        :rtype: List[str]        """        dic = {}        lst = []        res = []        minSum = float('inf')        for i,v in enumerate(list1):            dic[v] = i        for i,v in enumerate(list2):            if v in dic:                summ = dic[v] + i                if summ < minSum:                    res = [v]                    minSum = summ                elif summ == minSum:                    res.append(v)        return res
